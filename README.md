# 🧠 UNIX Utility Suite

A modular collection of simple UNIX-style utilities written in **C** and managed by a single **Bash script (`unix.sh`)**.  
This project combines multiple core operating system concepts — including **process management**, **CPU scheduling**, and **GUI utilities** — under one unified launcher.
